	<h2>Nigiri</h2>
	<p>Nigirizushi consists of an oblong mound of sushi rice that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, A topping (the neta) draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of wasabi, Neta are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of nori, most commonly octopus (tako), freshwater eel (unagi), sea eel (anago), squid (ika), and sweet egg (tamago). One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain only one piece of each topping.</p>

	<h2>Sushi</h2>
	<p>Sushi is a type of food preparation originating in Japan, consisting of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients such as raw seafood, vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but the ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice (also referred to as shari or sumeshi).
