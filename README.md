              o The confirmation lists all the information the user has provided, without displaying any sensitive information.
              o Upon confirming the information is correct, the data is securely inserted into the database and a successful registration message is displayed;
        - Provide the user with an ‘Edit’ option for editing their registration information. 
              o Upon ‘submit’ the user’s information is inserted/updated in the database.
        - Provide the user with a ‘My Account’ or ‘My Profile’ link to on the lab, that allows them to make changes to their account.
              o This link is visible on the site without prior login but prompts users to log-in, if they have not already done so.
              o Logged in users are able to:
                  • Delete or Cancel their account; 
                  • Update their profile; 
                  • Change their password. 
         - Use an AJAX message for indicating the user has successfully registered. 
              o Incorporate a ‘My Account’ or ‘My Profile’ link;
                  • If the user is not logged in, clicking on this link to ask the user to log in;
                  • If the user is logged in, a welcome message with the name or username of the authenticated users is displayed (e.g. ‘Hello username’).
